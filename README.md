ClashHeroesXcode is a game that runs without a graphical engine (console only) and you can only test it on your computer.

To make changes, go to the ClashHeroesXcode file, in Main, line 34 you can change the name of the party, and from line 9 to 18 you can change the print of the character classes.

In this game there are several types of weapons, weapons that heal, attack and prevent play.

You can create new weapons, player classes, chests, spells, by creating new class that will inherit from the base class for each entity.
(for example: class NewClass: PlayerClass).

You can execute it by Xcode as well as by iTerm.
